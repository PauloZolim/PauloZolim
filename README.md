## 👋 Hello, welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Paulo — but you can call me **Zolim** or **Zolas** — and I'm just starting out in the world of **programming**. My main goal is to become a **software developer**.

Outside of tech, I have two hobbies that keep me motivated and disciplined: **weight training** 🏋️ and **jiu-jitsu** 🥋 — both of which help me stay focused and push through challenges, just like in coding.

Here on my GitHub, you'll find projects and practice as I grow step by step in this journey. I'm always eager to learn and improve 💡.
